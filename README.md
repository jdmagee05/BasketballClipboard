BasketballClipboard
===================

Overview
----------
The BasketballClipboard project provides more functionality than just a clip board. On top of the clip board there is 
a practice editor and a stats sheet so far. There are further plans to implement more functionality.

### Clip board
The clip board allows coaches to draw up plays for players.

It is incomplete as of now but it will eventually have the ability to change the colour of the marker and also have 
an eraser.

### Practice Planner
This is a tool for allowing coaches to plan there practices.

- set a time for each drill to start, the name of the drill and the duration.
- Save practices.
- Load practices through the Practice Hub.
- From the Practice Hub you can create new practices.
- Delete unwanted or old practices.

### Statistics Sheet
Keep track of each individual players' statistics throughout the game.
